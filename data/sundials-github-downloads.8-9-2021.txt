targeting Intel GPUs. At present the only SYCL compiler supported is the DPC++ (Intel oneAPI) compiler. See the SYCL NVECTOR section in the user guide for more details.\r\n\r\nA new SUNMatrix and SUNLinearSolver implementation were added to interface with the MAGMA linear algebra library. Both the matrix and the linear solver support general dense linear systems as well as block diagonal linear systems, and both are targeted at GPUs (AMD or NVIDIA).\r\n\r\nThese features are considered experimental and are subject to major changes even in minor releases.\r\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LLNL/sundials/releases/35325160", "assets_url":

This module is considered experimental and is subject to\r\nchange from version to version.\r\n\r\nThe RAJA NVECTOR implementation has been updated to support the HIP backend\r\nin addition to the CUDA backend. Users can choose the backend when configuring\r\nSUNDIALS by using the `SUNDIALS_RAJA_BACKENDS` CMake variable. This module\r\nremains experimental and is subject to change from version to version.\r\n\r\nA new optional operation, `N_VGetDeviceArrayPointer`, was added to the N_Vector\r\nAPI. This operation is useful for N_Vectors that utilize dual memory spaces,\r\ne.g. the native SUNDIALS CUDA N_Vector.\r\n\r\nThe SUNMATRIX_CUSPARSE and SUNLINEARSOLVER_CUSOLVERSP_BATCHQR implementations\r\nno longer require the SUNDIALS CUDA N_Vector. Instead, they require that the vector\r\nutilized provides the `N_VGetDeviceArrayPointer` operation, and that the pointer\r\nreturned by `N_VGetDeviceArrayPointer` is a valid CUDA device pointer."},

Fixed bug for ERK method integration with\r\nstatic mass matrices.\r\n\r\nAn interface between ARKStep and the XBraid multigrid reduction in time (MGRIT)\r\nlibrary has been added to enable parallel-in-time integration. See the ARKStep\r\ndocumentation and examples for more details. This interface required the\r\naddition of three new N_Vector operations to exchange vector data between\r\ncomputational nodes, see `N_VBufSize`, `N_VBufPack`, and `N_VBufUnpack`. These\r\nN_Vector operations are only used within the XBraid interface and need not be\r\nimplemented for any other context.\r\n\r\nUpdated the MRIStep time-stepping module in ARKode to support\r\nhigher-order MRI-GARK methods [Sandu, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 57, 2019],\r\nincluding methods that involve solve-decoupled, diagonally-implicit\r\ntreatment of the slow time scale.\r\n\r\nA new API, `SUNMemoryHelper`, was added to support **GPU users** who have complex\r\nmemory management needs such as using memory pools. This is paired with new\r\nconstructors for the `NVECTOR_CUDA` and `NVECTOR_RAJA` modules that accept a\r\n`SUNMemoryHelper` object. Refer to \"The SUNMemoryHelper API\", \"NVECTOR CUDA\"\r\nand \"NVECTOR RAJA\" sections in the documentation for more information.\r\n\r\nThe `NVECTOR_RAJA` module has been updated to mirror the `NVECTOR_CUDA` module.\r\nNotably, the update adds managed memory support to the `NVECTOR_RAJA` module.\r\nUsers of the module will need to update any calls to the `N_VMake_Raja` function\r\nbecause that signature was changed. This module remains experimental and is\r\nsubject to change from version to version.\r\n\r\nAdded new `SetLSNormFactor()` functions to CVODE(S), ARKODE, and IDA(S) to\r\nto specify the factor for converting between integrator tolerances (WRMS norm)\r\nand linear solver tolerances (L2 norm) i.e., `tol_L2 = nrmfac * tol_WRMS`.\r\n\r\nAdded new reset functions `ARKStepReset()`, `ERKStepReset()`, and\r\n`MRIStepReset()` to reset the stepper time and state vector to user-provided\r\nvalues for continuing the integration from that point while retaining the\r\nintegration history. These function complement the reinitialization functions\r\n`ARKStepReInit()`, `ERKStepReInit()`, and `MRIStepReInit()` which reinitialize\r\nthe stepper so that the problem integration should resume as if started from\r\nscratch.\r\n\r\nAdded new functions for advanced users providing a custom `SUNNonlinSolSysFn`.\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior of `SUNNonlinSolGetNumIters` and\r\n`SUNNonlinSolGetNumConvFails` in the SUNNonlinearSolver API have been updated to\r\nspecify that they should return the number of nonlinear solver iterations and\r\nconvergence failures in the most recent solve respectively rather than the\r\ncumulative number of iterations and failures across all solves respectively. The\r\nAPI documentation and SUNDIALS provided SUNNonlinearSolver implementations and\r\nhave been updated accordingly. As before, the cumulative number of nonlinear\r\niterations and failures may be retreived by calling the integrator provided get\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\n**This change may cause a runtime error in existing user code**.\r\nIn IDAS and CVODES, the functions for forward integration with checkpointing\r\n(`IDASolveF`, `CVodeF`) are now subject to a restriction on the number of time\r\nsteps allowed to reach the output time. This is the same restriction applied to\r\nthe `IDASolve` and `CVode` functions. The default maximum number of steps is\r\n500, but this may be changed using the `<IDA|CVode>SetMaxNumSteps` function.\r\nThis change fixes a bug that could cause an infinite loop in the `IDASolveF`\r\nand `CVodeF` and functions.\r\n\r\nA minor inconsistency in CVODE(S) and a bug ARKODE when checking the Jacobian\r\nevaluation frequency has been fixed. As a result codes using using a\r\nnon-default Jacobian update frequency through a call to\r\n`CVodeSetMaxStepsBetweenJac` or `ARKStepSetMaxStepsBetweenJac` will need to\r\nincrease the provided value by 1 to achieve the same behavior as before.

SUNDIALS must be built with the CMake option\r\n`SUNDIALS_BUILD_WITH_MONITORING` to use these capabilities.\r\n\r\nAdded a new function, `CVodeSetMonitorFn`, that takes a user-function\r\nto be called by CVODE after every `nst` succesfully completed time-steps.\r\nThis is intended to provide a way of monitoring the CVODE statistics\r\nthroughout the simulation.\r\n\r\nAdded specialized fused CUDA kernels to CVODE which may offer better\r\nperformance on smaller problems when using CVODE with the `NVECTOR_CUDA`\r\nmodule.

The\r\nconstructor N_VNewEmpty() allocates an ``empty'' generic NVECTOR with the\r\nobject's content pointer and the function pointers in the operations structure\r\ninitialized to NULL. When used in the constructor for custom objects this function\r\nwill ease the introduction of any new optional operations to the NVECTOR API by\r\nensuring only required operations need to be set. Additionally, the function\r\nN_VCopyOps(w, v) has been added to copy the operation function pointers between\r\nvector objects. When used in clone routines for custom vector objects these\r\nfunctions also will ease the introduction of any new optional operations to the\r\nNVECTOR API by ensuring all operations are copied when cloning objects.\r\n\r\nTwo new N_Vector implementations, NVECTOR_MANYVECTOR and NVECTOR_MPIMANYVECTOR,\r\nhave been created to support flexible partitioning of solution data among\r\ndifferent processing elements (e.g., CPU + GPU) or for multi-physics problems\r\nthat couple distinct MPI-based simulations together (see the NVECTOR_MANYVECTOR\r\nand NVECTOR_MPIMANYVECTOR sections in the user guides for more details). This\r\nimplementation is accompanied by additions to user documentation and SUNDIALS\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nAn additional NVECTOR implementation, NVECTOR_MPIPLUSX, has been created to\r\nsupport the MPI+X paradigm where X is a type of on-node parallelism (e.g.,\r\nOpenMP, CUDA). The implementation is accompanied by additions to user\r\ndocumentation and SUNDIALS examples.\r\n\r\nOne new required vector operation and ten new optional vector operations have\r\nbeen added to the NVECTOR API. The new required operation, N_VGetLength, returns\r\nthe global length of an N_Vector. The optional operations have been added to\r\nsupport the new NVECTOR_MPIMANYVECTOR implementation. The operation\r\nN_VGetCommunicator must be implemented by subvectors that are combined to create\r\nan NVECTOR_MPIMANYVECTOR, but is not used outside of this context. The\r\nremaining nine operations are optional local reduction operations intended to\r\neliminate unnecessary latency when performing vector reduction operations\r\n(norms, etc.) on distributed memory systems. The optional local reduction vector\r\noperations are N_VDotProdLocal, N_VMaxNormLocal, N_VMinLocal, N_VL1NormLocal,\r\nN_VWSqrSumLocal, N_VWSqrSumMaskLocal, N_VInvTestLocal, N_VConstrMaskLocal, and\r\nN_VMinQuotientLocal. If an NVECTOR implementation defines any of the local\r\noperations as NULL, then the NVECTOR_MPIMANYVECTOR will call standard NVECTOR\r\noperations to complete the computation.\r\n\r\nThe *_MPICuda and *_MPIRaja functions have been removed from the NVECTOR_CUDA\r\nand NVECTOR_RAJA implementations respectively. Accordingly, the\r\nnvector_mpicuda.h, nvector_mpiraja.h, libsundials_nvecmpicuda.lib, and\r\nlibsundials_nvecmpicudaraja.lib files have been removed. Users should use the\r\nNVECTOR_MPIPLUSX module in conjunction with the NVECTOR_CUDA or NVECTOR_RAJA\r\nmodules to replace the functionality. The necessary changes are minimal and\r\nshould require few code modifications.\r\n\r\nFixed a memory leak in the NVECTOR_PETSC clone function.\r\n\r\nMade performance improvements to the CUDA NVECTOR. Users who utilize a non\r\n-default stream should no longer see default stream synchronizations after\r\nmemory transfers.\r\n\r\nAdded a new constructor to the CUDA NVECTOR that allows a user to provide\r\ncustom allocate and free functions for the vector data array and internal\r\nreduction buffer.\r\n\r\nAdded new Fortran 2003 interfaces for most NVECTOR modules. See NEVTOR section\r\nin the user guides for more details on how to use the interfaces.\r\n\r\nAdded three new NVECTOR utility functions, `FN_VGetVecAtIndexVectorArray`,\r\n`FN_VSetVecAtIndexVectorArray`, and `FN\\_VNewVectorArray`, for working with\r\n`N_Vector` arrays when using the Fortran 2003 interfaces.\r\n\r\n### SUNMatrix\r\n\r\nTwo new functions were added to aid in creating custom SUNMATRIX objects. The\r\nconstructor SUNMatNewEmpty() allocates an ``empty'' generic SUNMATRIX with the\r\nobject's content pointer and the function pointers in the operations structure\r\ninitialized to NULL. When used in the constructor for custom objects this function\r\nwill ease the introduction of any new optional operations to the SUNMATRIX API by\r\nensuring only required operations need to be set. Additionally, the function\r\nSUNMatCopyOps(A, B) has been added to copy the operation function pointers between\r\nmatrix objects. When used in clone routines for custom matrix objects these\r\nfunctions also will ease the introduction of any new optional operations to the\r\nSUNMATRIX API by ensuring all operations are copied when cloning objects.\r\n\r\nA new operation, SUNMatMatvecSetup, was added to the SUNMatrix API. Users\r\nwho have implemented custom SUNMatrix modules will need to at least update\r\ntheir code to set the corresponding ops structure member, matvecsetup, to NULL.\r\n\r\nThe generic SUNMatrix API now defines error codes to be returned by SUNMatrix operations.\r\nOperations which return an integer flag indiciating success/failure may return different\r\nvalues than previously.\r\n\r\nA new SUNMatrix (and SUNLinearSolver) implementation was added to facilitate\r\nthe use of the SuperLU_DIST library with SUNDIALS.\r\n\r\nAdded new Fortran 2003 interfaces for most SUNMATRIX modules. See SUNMATRIX\r\nsection in the user guides for more details on how to use the interfaces.\r\n\r\n### SUNLinearSolver\r\n\r\nA new function was added to aid in creating custom SUNLINEARSOLVER objects. The\r\nconstructor SUNLinSolNewEmpty() allocates an ``empty'' generic SUNLINEARSOLVER\r\nwith the object's content pointer and the function pointers in the operations\r\nstructure initialized to NULL. When used in the constructor for custom objects\r\nthis function will ease the introduction of any new optional operations to the\r\nSUNLINEARSOLVER API by ensuring only required operations need to be set.\r\n\r\nThe return type of the SUNLinearSolver API function `SUNLinSolLastFlag` has\r\nchanged from `long int` to `sunindextype` to be consistent with the type\r\nused to store row indices in dense and banded linear solver modules.\r\n\r\nAdded a new optional operation to the SUNLINEARSOLVER API, `SUNLinSolGetID`,\r\nthat returns a `SUNLinearSolver_ID` for identifying the linear solver module.\r\n\r\nThe SUNLinearSolver API has been updated to make the initialize and setup\r\nfunctions optional.\r\n\r\nA new SUNLinearSolver (and SUNMatrix) implementation was added to facilitate\r\nthe use of the SuperLU_DIST library with SUNDIALS.\r\n\r\nAdded a new SUNLinearSolver implementation, `SUNLinearSolver_cuSolverSp_batchQR`,\r\nwhich leverages the NVIDIA cuSOLVER sparse batched QR method for efficiently\r\nsolving block diagonal linear systems on NVIDIA GPUs.\r\n\r\nAdded three new accessor functions to the SUNLinSol_KLU module,\r\n`SUNLinSol_KLUGetSymbolic()`, `SUNLinSol_KLUGetNumeric()`, and\r\n`SUNLinSol_KLUGetCommon()`, to provide user access to the underlying\r\nKLU solver structures.\r\n\r\nAdded new Fortran 2003 interfaces for most SUNLINEARSOLVER modules. See\r\nSUNLINEARSOLVER section in the user guides for more details on how to use\r\nthe interfaces.\r\n\r\n### SUNNonlinearSolver\r\n\r\nA new function was added to aid in creating custom SUNNONLINEARSOLVER objects.\r\nThe constructor SUNNonlinSolNewEmpty() allocates an ``empty'' generic\r\nSUNNONLINEARSOLVER with the object's content pointer and the function pointers\r\nin the operations structure initialized to NULL. When used in the constructor\r\nfor custom objects this function will ease the introduction of any new optional\r\noperations to the SUNNONLINEARSOLVER API by ensuring only required operations\r\nneed to be set.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the use of user supplied nonlinear solver convergence test\r\nfunctions the `SUNNonlinSolSetConvTestFn` function in the SUNNonlinearSolver API\r\nhas been updated to take a `void*` data pointer as input. The supplied data\r\npointer will be passed to the nonlinear solver convergence test function on each\r\ncall.\r\n\r\nThe inputs values passed to the first two inputs of the `SUNNonlinSolSolve`\r\nfunction in the SUNNONLINEARSOLVER have been changed to be the predicted\r\nstate and the initial guess for the correction to that state. Additionally,\r\nthe definitions of `SUNNonlinSolLSetupFn` and `SUNNonlinSolLSolveFn` in the\r\nSUNNonlinearSolver API have been updated to remove unused input parameters.\r\nFor more information on the nonlinear system formulation and the API functions\r\nsee the SUNNONLINEARSOLVER chapter in the user guides.\r\n\r\nAdded a new `SUNNonlinearSolver` implementation, `SUNNonlinsol_PetscSNES`,\r\nwhich interfaces to the PETSc SNES nonlinear solver API.\r\n\r\nAdded new Fortran 2003 interfaces for most SUNNONLINEARSOLVER modules. See\r\nSUNNONLINEARSOLVER section in the user guides for more details on how to use\r\nthe interfaces.\r\n\r\n### CVODE and CVODES\r\n\r\nFixed a bug in the CVODE and CVODES constraint handling where the step size\r\ncould be set below the minimum step size.\r\n\r\nFixed a bug in the CVODE and CVODES nonlinear solver interfaces where the norm\r\nof the accumulated correction was not updated when using a non-default\r\nconvergence test function.\r\n\r\nFixed a bug in the CVODES `cvRescale` function where the loops to compute the\r\narray of scalars for the fused vector scale operation stopped one iteration\r\nearly.\r\n\r\nFixed a bug in CVODES where CVodeF would return the wrong flag under certain\r\ncirumstances.\r\n\r\nFixed a bug in CVODES where CVodeF would not return a root in NORMAL_STEP mode\r\nif the root occurred after the desired output time.\r\n\r\nFixed a memeory leak in FCVODE when not using the default nonlinear solver.\r\n\r\nRemoved extraneous calls to N_VMin() for simulations where the scalar valued\r\nabsolute tolerance, or all entries of the vector-valued absolute tolerance\r\narray, are strictly positive. In this scenario CVODE and CVODES will remove\r\nat least one global reduction per time step.\r\n\r\nThe CVLS interface has been updated to only zero the Jacobian matrix before\r\ncalling a user-supplied Jacobian evaluation function when the attached linear\r\nsolver has type `SUNLINEARSOLVER_DIRECT`.\r\n\r\nA new linear solver interface function, `CVLsLinSysFn`, was added as an\r\nalternative method for evaluating the linear systems I - gamma J.\r\n\r\nAdded functions to get the current state and gamma value to CVODE and CVODES.\r\nThese functions may be useful to users who chose to provide their own nonlinear\r\nsolver implementation.\r\n\r\nAdded New Fortran 2003 interfaces to CVODE and CVODES were added. These new\r\ninterfaces were generated with SWIG-Fortran and provide a user an idiomatic\r\nFortran 2003 interface to most of the SUNDIALS C API. The existing CVODE F2003\r\ninterface, and all module implementations with existing Fortran 2003 interfaces\r\nwere updated accordingly. See the section \"Using CVODE for Fortran\r\nApplications\" and \"Using CVODES for Fortran Applications\" in the appropriate\r\nuser guide for more details on how to use the interfaces.\r\n\r\n### ARKode\r\n\r\nThe MRIStep module has been updated to support explicit, implicit, or IMEX\r\nmethods as the fast integrator using the ARKStep module. As a result some\r\nfunction signatures have been changed including MRIStepCreate which now\r\ntakes an ARKStep memory structure for the fast integration as an input.\r\n\r\nFixed a bug in the ARKStep time-stepping module in ARKode that would result in an\r\ninfinite loop if the nonlinear solver failed to converge more than the maximum\r\nallowed times during a single step.\r\n\r\nFixed a bug in ARKode that would result in a \"too much accuracy requested\" error\r\nwhen using fixed time step sizes with explicit methods in some cases.\r\n\r\nFixed a bug in ARKStep where the mass matrix linear solver setup function was\r\nnot called in the Matrix-free case.\r\n\r\nFixed a minor bug in ARKStep where an incorrect flag is reported when an\r\nerror occurs in the mass matrix setup or Jacobian-vector product setup\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nFixed a memeory leak in FARKODE when not using the default nonlinear solver.\r\n\r\nThe reinitialization functions `ERKStepReInit()`, `ARKStepReInit()`, and\r\n`MRIStepReInit()` have been updated to retain the minimum and maxiumum step\r\nsize values from before reinitialization rather than resetting them to the\r\ndefault values.\r\n\r\nRemoved extraneous calls to N_VMin() for simulations where the scalar valued\r\nabsolute tolerance, or all entries of the vector-valued absolute tolerance\r\narray, are strictly positive. In this scenario ARKode steppers will remove\r\nat least one global reduction per time step.\r\n\r\nThe ARKLS interface has been updated to only zero the Jacobian matrix before\r\ncalling a user-supplied Jacobian evaluation function when the attached linear\r\nsolver has type `SUNLINEARSOLVER_DIRECT`.\r\n\r\nA new linear solver interface function, `ARKLsLinSysFn`, was added as an\r\nalternative method for evaluating the linear systems M - gamma J and\r\nI - gamma J.\r\n\r\nAdded two new embedded ARK methods of orders 4 and 5 to ARKode (from\r\nKennedy & Carpenter, Appl. Numer. Math., 136:183--205, 2019).\r\n\r\nSupport for optional inequality constraints on individual components of the\r\nsolution vector has been added the ARKode ERKStep and ARKStep modules. See\r\nthe descriptions of ERKStepSetConstraints and ARKStepSetConstraints for\r\nmore details. Note that enabling constraint handling requires the NVECTOR\r\noperations N_VMinQuotient, N_VConstrMask, and N_VCompare that were not\r\npreviously required by ARKode.\r\n\r\nAdded functions to get the current state and gamma value to the ARKStep module.\r\nThese functions may be useful to users who chose to provide their own nonlinear\r\nsolver implementation.\r\n\r\nAdd two new 'Set' functions to MRIStep, `MRIStepSetPreInnerFn()` and\r\n`MRIStepSetPostInnerFn()` for performing communication or memory\r\ntransfers needed before or after the inner integration.\r\n\r\nAdded new Fortran 2003 interfaces to all ARKode stepper modules. These new\r\ninterfaces were generated with SWIG-Fortran and provide a user an idiomatic\r\nFortran 2003 interface to most of the SUNDIALS C API. See the section \"Using\r\nARKode for Fortran Applications\" in the user guide for more details on how\r\nto use the interfaces.\r\n\r\n### IDA and IDAS\r\n\r\nA bug was fixed in the IDA and IDAS linear solver interfaces where an incorrect\r\nJacobian-vector product increment was used with iterative solvers other than\r\nSPGMR and SPFGMR.\r\n\r\nFixed a bug in IDAS where IDASolveF would return the wrong flag under certain\r\ncirumstances.\r\n\r\nFixed a bug in IDAS where IDASolveF would not return a root in NORMAL_STEP mode\r\nif the root occurred after the desired output time.\r\n\r\nFixed a bug the IDAS IDAQuadReInitB function where an incorrect memory structure\r\nwas passed to IDAQuadReInit.\r\n\r\nFixed a memeory leak in FIDA when not using the default nonlinear solver.\r\n\r\nRemoved extraneous calls to N_VMin() for simulations where the scalar valued\r\nabsolute tolerance, or all entries of the vector-valued absolute tolerance\r\narray, are strictly positive. In this scenario IDA and IDAS will remove\r\nat least one global reduction per time step.\r\n\r\nThe IDALS interface has been updated to only zero the Jacobian matrix before\r\ncalling a user-supplied Jacobian evaluation function when the attached linear\r\nsolver has type SUNLINEARSOLVER_DIRECT.\r\n\r\nAdded new Fortran 2003 interfaces to IDA and IDAS. These new interfaces were\r\ngenerated with SWIG-Fortran and provide a user an idiomatic Fortran 2003\r\ninterface to most of the SUNDIALS C API.  See the section \"Using IDA for Fortran\r\nApplications\" and \"Using IDAS for Fortran Applications\" in the appropriate\r\nuser guide for more details on how to use the interfaces.\r\n\r\n### KINSOL\r\n\r\nFixed a bug in the KINSOL linear solver interface where the auxiliary scalar\r\n`sJpnorm` was not computed when necessary with the Picard iteration and the\r\nauxiliary scalar `sFdotJp` was unnecessarily computed in some cases.\r\n\r\nThe KINLS interface has been updated to only zero the Jacobian matrix before\r\ncalling a user-supplied Jacobian evaluation function when the attached linear\r\nsolver has type SUNLINEARSOLVER_DIRECT.\r\n\r\nAdded new Fortran 2003 interfaces to KINSOL. These new interfaces were\r\ngenerated with SWIG-Fortran and provide a user an idiomatic Fortran 2003\r\ninterface to most of the SUNDIALS C API.  See the section \"Using KINSOL for\r\nFortran Applications\" for more details on how to use the interfaces.\r\n\r\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LLNL/sundials/releases/20027507", "assets_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LLNL/sundials/releases/20027507/assets", "upload_url": "https://uploads.github.com/repos/LLNL/sundials/releases/20027507/assets{?name,label}", "html_url": "https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/releases/tag/v5.0.0-dev.2", "id": 20027507, "author": {"login": "balos1", "id": 5669480, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU2Njk0ODA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5669480?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1", "html_url": "https://github.com/balos1", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "node_id": "MDc6UmVsZWFzZTIwMDI3NTA3", "tag_name": "v5.0.0-dev.2", "target_commitish": "develop", "name": "SUNDIALS development release v5.0.0-dev.2", "draft": false, "prerelease": true, "created_at": "2019-09-16T20:17:58Z", "published_at": "2019-09-16T20:26:14Z", "assets": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LLNL/sundials/releases/assets/14952358", "id": 14952358, "node_id": "MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDE0OTUyMzU4", "name": "sundials-5.0.0-dev.2.tar.gz", "label": null, "uploader": {"login": "balos1", "id": 5669480, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU2Njk0ODA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5669480?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1", "html_url": "https://github.com/balos1", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "content_type": "application/gzip", "state": "uploaded", "size": 18509897, "download_count": 7, "created_at": "2019-09-16T20:26:34Z", "updated_at": "2019-09-16T20:26:36Z", "browser_download_url": "https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/releases/download/v5.0.0-dev.2/sundials-5.0.0-dev.2.tar.gz"}], "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LLNL/sundials/tarball/v5.0.0-dev.2", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LLNL/sundials/zipball/v5.0.0-dev.2", "body": "## Changes to SUNDIALS in release 5.0.0-dev.2\r\n\r\nAdded a new optional operation to the SUNLINEARSOLVER API, `SUNLinSolGetID`,\r\nthat returns a `SUNLinearSolver_ID` for identifying the linear solver module.\r\n\r\nMade performance improvements to the CUDA NVECTOR.

latest release, v5.0.0-dev.1, is a beta release of the next major SUNDIALS version and offers a preview of what is to come in SUNDIALS. The release includes new Fortran 2003 interface modules that provide Fortran users access to most of the SUNDIALS C API including the CVODE, ARKode, IDA, and KINSOL packages. The release also includes new linear solver interface functions, ARKLsLinSysFn and CVLsLinSysFn, which can be used as alternative methods for evaluating matrices for the linear systems M - gamma J and I - gamma J respectively, a new N_Vector implementation, NVECTOR_MPIPLUSX, which supports the MPI+X paradigm where X is a type of on-node parallelism such as CUDA, and several other improvements and bug fixes. We do not foresee any major API changes occurring between this release and v5.0.0, but various minor improvements are planned.\r\n\r\n## List of Changes\r\n\r\nSeveral new functions were added to aid in creating custom NVECTOR,\r\nSUNMATRIX, SUNLINEARSOLVER, and SUNNONLINEARSOLVER objects. The constructors\r\nN_VNewEmpty(), SUNMatNewEmpty(), SUNLinSolNewEmpty(), and SUNNonlinSolNewEmpty()\r\nallocate ``empty'' generic NVECTOR, SUNMATRIX, SUNLINEARSOLVER, and\r\nSUNNONLINEARSOLVER objects respectively with the object's content pointer and\r\nthe function pointers in the operations structure initialized to NULL. When used\r\nin the constructor for custom objects these functions will ease the introduction\r\nof any new optional operations to the NVECTOR, SUNMATRIX, SUNLINEARSOLVER, or\r\nSUNNONLINEARSOLVER APIs by ensuring only required operations need to be set.\r\nAdditionally, the functions N_VCopyOps(w, v) and SUNMatCopyOps(A, B) have been\r\nadded to copy the operation function pointers between vector and matrix objects\r\nrespectively. When used in clone routines for custom vector and matrix objects\r\nthese functions also will ease the introduction of any new optional operations\r\nto the NVECTOR or SUNMATRIX APIs by ensuring all operations are copied when\r\ncloning objects.\r\n\r\nNew linear solver interface functions ARKLsLinSysFn and CVLsLinSysFn were added\r\nas alternative methods for evaluating the linear systems M - gamma J and\r\nI - gamma J respectively.\r\n\r\nFixed a bug in the build system that prevented the PThreads NVECTOR module from\r\nbeing built.\r\n\r\nFixed a bug in ARKStep where the mass matrix linear solver setup function was\r\nnot called in the Matrix-free case.\r\n\r\nFixed a minor bug in ARKStep where an incorrect flag is reported when an\r\nerror occurs in the mass matrix setup or Jacobian-vector product setup\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nFixed a memory leak in the NVECTOR_PETSC clone function.\r\n\r\nFixed a memeory leaks in FARKODE, FCVODE, and FIDA when not using the default\r\nnonlinear solver.\r\n\r\nFixed a bug in IDAQuadReInitB where an incorrect memory structure was passed to\r\nIDAQuadReInit.\r\n\r\nAdded two new embedded ARK methods of orders 4 and 5 to ARKode (from\r\nKennedy & Carpenter, Appl. Numer. Math., 136:183--205, 2019).\r\n\r\nThe ManyVector NVECTOR module has been split into two versions: one\r\nthat requires MPI (MPIManyVector) and another that does not use\r\nMPI at all (ManyVector).  The associated example problems have\r\nbeen similarly updated to reflect this new structure.\r\n\r\nAn additional NVECTOR implementation, NVECTOR_MPIPLUSX, was created to support\r\nthe MPI+X paradigm where X is a type of on-node parallelism (e.g. OpenMP, CUDA).\r\nThe implementation is accompanied by additions to user documentation and SUNDIALS\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nThe *_MPICuda and *_MPIRaja functions were removed from the NVECTOR_CUDA and \r\nNVECTOR_RAJA implementations respectively. Accordingly, the nvector_mpicuda.h,\r\nnvector_mpiraja.h, libsundials_nvecmpicuda.lib, and libsundials_nvecmpicudaraja.lib\r\nfiles have been removed. Users should use the NVECTOR_MPIPLUSX module coupled with\r\nthe NVECTOR_CUDA or NVECTOR_RAJA to replace the functionality. The necessary changes\r\nare minimal and should require few code modifications.\r\n\r\nNew Fortran 2003 interfaces to ARKODE, IDA, KINSOL, all generic SUNDIALS types\r\n(i.e. NVECTOR, SUNMATRIX, SUNLINEARSOLVER, SUNNONLINEARSOLVER), and the \r\nNVECTOR_PARALLEL were added. These new interfaces were generated with SWIG-Fortran\r\nand provide a user an idiomatic Fortran 2003 interface to most of the SUNDIALS C API.\r\nThe CVODE interface, and all module implementations with existing Fortran 2003 interfaces\r\nwere updated accordingly. See the section  \"Using <SOLVER> for Fortran Applications\" in\r\nthe appropriate user guide for more details on how to use the interfaces.\r\n\r\nRemoved extraneous calls to N_VMin() for simulations where\r\nthe scalar valued absolute tolerance, or all entries of the\r\nvector-valued absolute tolerance array, are strictly positive.  In\r\nthis scenario, CVODE(S), IDA(S) and ARKode will remove at least one\r\nglobal reduction per time step.\r\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LLNL/sundials/releases/16416387", "assets_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LLNL/sundials/releases/16416387/assets", "upload_url": "https://uploads.github.com/repos/LLNL/sundials/releases/16416387/assets{?name,label}", "html_url": "https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/releases/tag/v5.0.0-dev.0", "id": 16416387, "author": {"login": "balos1", "id": 5669480, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU2Njk0ODA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5669480?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1", "html_url": "https://github.com/balos1", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "node_id": "MDc6UmVsZWFzZTE2NDE2Mzg3", "tag_name": "v5.0.0-dev.0", "target_commitish": "develop", "name": "v5.0.0-dev.0", "draft": false, "prerelease": true, "created_at": "2019-03-28T17:10:27Z", "published_at": "2019-03-28T17:13:30Z", "assets": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LLNL/sundials/releases/assets/11777822", "id": 11777822, "node_id": "MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDExNzc3ODIy", "name": "sundials-5.0.0-dev.0.tar.gz", "label": null, "uploader": {"login": "balos1", "id": 5669480, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU2Njk0ODA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5669480?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1", "html_url": "https://github.com/balos1", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "content_type": "application/gzip", "state": "uploaded", "size": 17636602, "download_count": 25, "created_at": "2019-03-28T17:13:16Z", "updated_at": "2019-03-28T17:13:18Z", "browser_download_url": "https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/releases/download/v5.0.0-dev.0/sundials-5.0.0-dev.0.tar.gz"}], "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LLNL/sundials/tarball/v5.0.0-dev.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LLNL/sundials/zipball/v5.0.0-dev.0", "body": "## Changes to SUNDIALS in release 5.0.0-dev.0\r\n\r\nAn additional N_Vector implementation, NVECTOR_MANYVECTOR, was\r\ncreated to support flexible partitioning of solution data among\r\ndifferent processing elements (e.g., CPU + GPU) or for multi-physics\r\nproblems that couple distinct MPI-based simulations together (see\r\nthe NVECTOR_MANYVECTOR section in the user guides for more details).\r\nThis implementation is accompanied by additions to user documentation\r\nand SUNDIALS examples.\r\n\r\nEleven new optional vector operations have been added to the N_Vector API to\r\nsupport the new NVECTOR_MANYVECTOR implementation (see N_Vector chapter is the\r\nuser guides for more details). Two of the operations, N_VGetCommunicator and\r\nN_VGetLength, must be implemented by subvectors that are combined to create an\r\nNVECTOR_MANYVECTOR, but are not used outside of this context. The remaining nine\r\noperations are optional local reduction operations intended to eliminate\r\nunnecessary latency when performing vector reduction operations (norms, etc.) on\r\ndistributed memory systems. The optional local reduction vector operations are\r\nN_VDotProdLocal, N_VMaxNormLocal, N_VMinLocal, N_VL1NormLocal, N_VWSqrSumLocal,\r\nN_VWSqrSumMaskLocal, N_VInvTestLocal, N_VConstrMaskLocal, and\r\nN_VMinQuotientLocal. If an N_Vector implementation defines any of the local\r\noperations as NULL, then the NVECTOR_MANYVECTOR will call standard N_Vector\r\noperations to complete the computation.\r\n\r\nAdditionally this release includes the following changes:\r\n\r\n* A new SUNMatrix and SUNLinearSolver implementation was added to facilitate \r\nthe use of the SuperLU_DIST library with SUNDIALS.\r\n\r\n* A new operation, SUNMatMatvecSetup, was added to the SUNMatrix API. Users\r\nwho have implemented custom SUNMatrix modules will need to at least update\r\ntheir code to set the corresponding ops structure member, matvecsetup, to NULL.\r\n\r\n* The generic SUNMatrix API now defines error codes to be returned by SUNMatrix operations.\r\nOperations which return an integer flag indiciating success/failure may return different\r\nvalues than previously.\r\n\r\n* The MRIStep module has been updated to support explicit, implicit, or IMEX\r\nmethods as the fast integrator using the ARKStep module. As a result some\r\nfunction signatures have been changed including MRIStepCreate which now\r\ntakes an ARKStep memory structure for the fast integration as an input.\r\n\r\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LLNL/sundials/releases/15546539", "assets_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LLNL/sundials/releases/15546539/assets", "upload_url": "https://uploads.github.com/repos/LLNL/sundials/releases/15546539/assets{?name,label}", "html_url": "https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/releases/tag/v4.1.0", "id": 15546539, "author": {"login": "balos1", "id": 5669480, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU2Njk0ODA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5669480?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1", "html_url": "https://github.com/balos1", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "node_id": "MDc6UmVsZWFzZTE1NTQ2NTM5", "tag_name": "v4.1.0", "target_commitish": "master", "name": "v4.1.0", "draft": false, "prerelease": false, "created_at": "2019-02-13T22:35:59Z", "published_at": "2019-02-13T22:38:04Z", "assets": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LLNL/sundials/releases/assets/11070369", "id": 11070369, "node_id": "MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDExMDcwMzY5", "name": "sundials-4.1.0.tar.gz", "label": null, "uploader": {"login": "balos1", "id": 5669480, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU2Njk0ODA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5669480?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1", "html_url": "https://github.com/balos1", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balos1/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "content_type": "application/gzip", "state": "uploaded", "size": 17221960, "download_count": 990, "created_at": "2019-02-13T22:37:58Z", "updated_at": "2019-02-13T22:38:00Z", "browser_download_url": "https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/releases/download/v4.1.0/sundials-4.1.0.tar.gz"}], "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LLNL/sundials/tarball/v4.1.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LLNL/sundials/zipball/v4.1.0", "body": "## Changes in minor release SUNDIALS v.4.1.0\r\n\r\nAn additional `N_Vector` implementation was added for Tpetra vector from Trilinos library to facilitate interoperability between SUNDIALS and Trilinos.

"https://api.github.com/repos/LLNL/sundials/zipball/v4.0.0", "body": "## Changes in major release SUNDIALS v.4.0.0\r\n\r\nThe direct and iterative linear solver interfaces in all SUNDIALS packages have been merged into unified linear solver interfaces for each package that support any valid SUNLINSOL module. This includes the previous DIRECT and ITERATIVE types and the new MATRIX_ITERATIVE type. Details regarding how SUNDIALS packages utilize linear solvers of each type as well as discussion regarding intended use cases for user-supplied SUNLINSOL implementations are included in the SUNLINSOL chapter of the user guides.\r\n\r\nThe unified interfaces are very similar to the previous DLS and SPILS interfaces. To minimize challenges in user migration to the unified linear solver interfaces, the previous DLS and SPILS routines for all packages may still be used; these will be deprecated in future releases, so we recommend that users migrate to the new names soon. Additionally, we note that Fortran users will need to enlarge their iout array of optional integer outputs, and update the indices that they query for certain linear-solver-related statistics.\r\n\r\nThe names of all constructor routines for SUNDIALS-provided SUNLinSol implementations have been updated to follow the naming convention SUNLinSol_* where * is the name of the linear solver e.g., Dense, KLU, SPGMR, PCG, etc. Solver-specific \u201cset\u201d routine names have been similarly standardized. To minimize challenges in user migration to the new names, the previous routine names may still be used; these will be deprecated in future releases, so we recommend that users migrate to the new names soon.\r\n\r\nSUNDIALS integrators (ARKode, CVODE, CVODES, IDA, and IDAS) have been updated to utilize generic nonlinear solver modules through the SUNNONLINSOL API. This API will ease the addition of new nonlinear solver options and allow for external or user-supplied nonlinear solvers. The SUNNONLINSOL API and provided SUNNONLINSOL modules are described in a new user guide chapter and follow the same object oriented design and implementation used by the NVECTOR, SUNMATRIX, and SUNLINSOL modules.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of SUNNonlinSol modules, the input parameter iter to CVodeCreate has been removed along with the function CVodeSetIterType and the constants CV_NEWTON and CV_FUNCTIONAL. Similarly, the ITMETH parameter has been removed from the Fortran interface function FCVMALLOC. Instead of specifying the nonlinear iteration type when creating the CVODE(S) memory structure, CVODE(S) uses the SUNNONLINSOL_NEWTON module implementation of a Newton iteration by default.For details on using a non-default or user-supplied nonlinear solver see the \u201cUsing CVODE[S] for \u2026\u201d chapters in the user guides. CVODE(S) functions for setting the nonlinear solver options (e.g., CVodeSetMaxNonlinIters) or getting nonlinear solver statistics (e.g., CVodeGetNumNonlinSolvIters) remain unchanged and internally call generic SUNNonlinSol functions as needed.\r\n\r\nBy default IDA(S) uses the SUNNONLINSOL_NEWTON module. Since IDA(S) previously only used an internal implementation of a Newton iteration no changes are required to user programs and functions for setting the nonlinear solver options (e.g., IDASetMaxNonlinIters) or getting nonlinear solver statistics (e.g., IDAGetNumNonlinSolvIters) remain unchanged and internally call generic SUNNonlinSol functions as needed. While SUNDIALS includes a fixed-point nonlinear solver module, it is not currently supported in IDA(S).For details on using a non-default or user-supplied nonlinear solver see the \u201cUsing IDA[S] for \u2026\u201d chapters in the user guides. Additionally, the example program idaRoberts_dns.c explicitly creates an attaches a SUNNONLINSOL_NEWTON object to demonstrate the process of creating and attaching a nonlinear solver module (note this is not necessary in general as IDA uses the SUNNONLINSOL_NEWTON module by default).\r\n\r\nThree fused vector operations and seven vector array operations have been added to the NVECTOR API. These optional operations are disabled by default and may be activated by calling vector specific routines after creating an NVECTOR. See the NVECTOR chapter in the user guides for more information on the new operations.\r\n\r\nAdded a new NVECTOR (NVECTOR_OPENMPDEV) which leverages OpenMP 4.5+ device offloading.\r\n\r\nMultiple updates to the CUDA NVECTOR were made:\r\n\r\n* Changed the N_VMake_Cuda function to take a host data pointer and a device data pointer instead of an N_VectorContent_Cuda object.\r\n* Changed N_VGetLength_Cuda to return the global vector length instead of the local vector length.\r\n* Added N_VGetLocalLength_Cuda to return the local vector length.\r\n* Added N_VGetMPIComm_Cuda to return the MPI communicator used.\r\n* Removed the accessor functions in the namespace suncudavec.  \r\n* Added the ability to set the cudaStream_t used for execution of the CUDA NVECTOR kernels. See the function N_VSetCudaStreams_Cuda.\r\n* Added N_VNewManaged_Cuda, N_VMakeManaged_Cuda, and N_VIsManagedMemory_Cuda functions to accommodate using managed memory with the CUDA NVECTOR.\r\n\r\nMultiple updates to the RAJA NVECTOR were made:\r\n\r\n* Changed N_VGetLength_Raja to return the global vector length instead of the local vector length.\r\n* Added N_VGetLocalLength_Raja to return the local vector length.\r\n* Added N_VGetMPIComm_Raja to return the MPI communicator used.\r\n* Removed the accessor functions in the namespace sunrajavec.\r\n\r\nThe SUNBandMatrix constructor has been simplified to remove the storage upper bandwidth argument.\r\n\r\nTwo changes were made in the CVODE/CVODES/ARKODE initial step size algorithm:\r\n\r\n* Fixed an efficiency bug where an extra call to the RHS function was made.\r\n* Changed the behavior of the algorithm if the max-iterations case is hit. Before the algorithm would exit with the step size calculated on the penultimate iteration. Now it will exit with the step size calculated on the final iteration.\r\n\r\nFortran 2003 interfaces to CVODE, the fixed-point and Newton nonlinear solvers, the dense, band, KLU, PCG, SPBCGS, SPFGMR, SPGMR, and SPTFQMR linear solvers, and the serial, PThreads, and OpenMP NVECTORs have been added.\r\n\r\nThe ARKode library has been entirely rewritten to support a modular approach to one-step methods, which should allow for rapid research and development of novel integration methods without affecting existing solver functionality.\r\n\r\nA new ARKode stepper, MRIStep, has been added for two rate explicit-explicit multirate infinitesimal step methods.\r\n\r\nARKode\u2019s dense output infrastructure has been improved to support higher-degree Hermite polynomial interpolants (up to degree 5) over the last successful time step."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/LLNL/sundials/releases/13493204", "assets_url":
